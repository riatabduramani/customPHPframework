# customPHPframework
This is custom PHP framework for my small projects. I decided to do this simple framework after the good experience with Laravel. The structure is based somehow as Laravel, but in deep it changes the way how I'm calling the things.

So, if you want to contribute to this project please do it.

Cheers!
